# Lab08-LINQ
*by Harry Cogswell*  
A program that brings in geographic data from an external file, reads the data, and can filter the data based on specified queries.

----

## Description
This program is a demonstration of the power of LINQ queries, it will walk you through the same dataset three times, under different filters. Using a parsed JSON file, it will display the names of various New York neighborhoods to you.
